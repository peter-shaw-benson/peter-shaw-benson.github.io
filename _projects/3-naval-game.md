I have always been fascinated with history, particularly influenced by my AP US History class, Dan Carlin's podcst "Hardcore History", and my current favorite, Everett Rummage's "Age of Napoleon" podcast.
When I found Montemayor's video series, ["The Battle of Midway 1942: Told from the Japanese Perspective (1/3)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd8_vO5zrjo), I became fascinated by naval history.

During this highly detailed documentary of the battle of Midway, he presents naval warfare as a cat-and-mouse game of limited information, with intelligence limited by factors such as scout planes getting lost, misidentifying ships, and naval codes playing major roles in victory and defeat.

With this project, I sought to simulate this environment of tense tactical decisions with limited informaiton. The current prototype has implemented the basics of naval combat, torpedo planes, plane pathfinding, and navigation. Future directions include team-based multiplayer, with each player taking on a unique role such as Air Controller, Fleet Admiral, Squadron Commander, and Signals Intelligence.
