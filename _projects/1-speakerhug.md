In Spring 2023, I managed the Boston shoegaze band "speakerhug". 
During this time, I handled their marketing, accounting, budgeting, day-of-show organization, and branding. 
This was a really fun way to get involved in the music scene of Boston â€“ prior to this, I was mainly a recording engineer, and hadn't dealt with many of the music business aspects of independent music. 
Managing speakerhug was also a great lesson in Entrepreneurship. 
I had a lot of fun doing market research and forming a business plan for the band. 
Under my leadership, the band released an EP entitled "scriptures", which you can stream here: [scriptures](https://open.spotify.com/album/1OEowPnZM0nfwbsvfS7k4u?si=Lqzz6lyKR6mHfv-8YTP5pw).
