In Spring 2023, I managed the Boston shoegaze band "speakerhug".

During this time, I handled their marketing, accounting, budgeting, day-of-show organization, and branding.
This was a really fun way to get involved in the music scene of Boston â€“ prior to this, I was mainly a recording engineer, and hadn't dealt with many of the music business aspects of independent music.
Managing speakerhug was also a great lesson in Entrepreneurship.
I had a lot of fun doing market research and forming a business plan for the band.


Under my leadership, the band released an EP entitled "scriptures", which you can stream here: [scriptures](https://open.spotify.com/album/1OEowPnZM0nfwbsvfS7k4u?si=Lqzz6lyKR6mHfv-8YTP5pw).


I also taught myself the basics of concert videography, which the band's lead singer, Lex Pappas, edited into day-of-show highlight videos:
