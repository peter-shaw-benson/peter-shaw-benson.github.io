In 2022, I dabbled in the world of professional audio recording, mixing, and mastering. 
Under the producer moniker "Sam Shaw" (my two middle names), I collaborated with multiple Boston-based independent artists to 
record, mix, and master songs which can now be found on Spotify.

These projects include Main Era:
[Dreamer](https://open.spotify.com/album/7pj30Xq7oEyJWFDdNvoLOT?si=f2qPplmHTm-OAZYOdhqgxA)

Rigs:
