In 2022, I dabbled in the world of professional audio recording, mixing, and mastering. 
Under the producer moniker "Sam Shaw" (my two middle names), I collaborated with multiple Boston-based independent artists to 
record, mix, and master songs which can now be found on Spotify. 

During this process, I learned a multitude of professional recording techniques, including mic selection, mic placement, and how to obtain the best takes from the artist. 
I also became quite adept at using Digital Audio Workstations, specifically Ableton and Pro Tools. 

These skills translated well to my work at the MIND Lab â€“ mixing served as a practical application of the music perception research that I would later work on. 
During my involvement with Green Line Records, I was able to bring my extensive knowledge of professional recording techniques to teach the newcomers in the club. 
Finally, I learned the importance of making connections and the basics of music copyright law.
