Work experience
======
* Summer 2023: **Develop for Good**
  * *Volunteer Engineering Manager*
  * Engineering manager for 8 team members on a volunteer project to predict plant ripeness based on worldwide time-series climate data.
  * Responsibilities include scheduling meetings across 4+ time zones, assigning team member responsibilities, and requirements engineering.
  * Collected and formatted climate and phenology data from multiple sources, including ERA-5, ECA&D, NPN, and Falling Fruit native observations. 
  * Adapted the algorithm described in Taylor & White, 2019 "Automated data-intensive forecasting of plant phenology throughout the United States" to the collected data. 
  * Developed a climate analysis pipeline based on for future use by [Falling Fruit](https://fallingfruit.org). 
 
* Jan 2023 - Present: **Music Imaging and Neural Dynamics Laboratory**
  * *Research Assistant*
  * Conducted a secondary analysis relating the Pleasurable Urge to Move to Music to musical anhedonia (Benson et. al, 2023, prepr.).
  * Proposed and conducted a behavioral psychological study relating timbre and amplitude envelope to perceived intentionality.
  * Current work combines Music Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing to measure the relationship between musical features and participant-generated narratives and measure individual creativity.

* Jan - June 2022: **Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority**
  * *Data Analytics Co-op*
  * Organized and led a project to modernize and overhaul daily data analysis workflows.
  * Developed, tested, and deployed a new model for logistics inventory management.
  * Analyzed historical inventory trends using pandas. 

* Summer 2019, 2020, December 2021: **Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory**
  * *Research Associate*
  * December 2021:
    * Prepared 30+ Docker Scripts of commonly used tools such as samtools, BLAT, and deeptools for internal use and external distribution.
    * Developed and deployed a CircleCI pipeline for testing and validating future modifications to these Docker Scripts.
  * Summer 2020:
    * Applied commonly used bioinformatics libraries to analyze the transcriptome of yeast cells with a Pcf11 mutation.  
    * Adapted legacy scientific software for use in modern bioinformatics pipelines.
    * Work culminated in a paper published in *Genetics*: Graber et. al, 2023, "Mutations in yeast Pcf11, a conserved protein essential for mRNA 3′ end processing and transcription termination, elicit the Environmental Stress Response". 
  * Summer 2019:
      * Reverse-Engineered deep learning algorithm presented in Bogard et. al, 2019: A Deep Neural Network for Predicting and Engineering Alternative Polyadenylation.
      * Applied a modified version of this algorithm to the yeast transcriptome using AWS. 
      * Visualized results, including loss metrics, using R and ggplot.
      * Presented findings at an end-of-summer poster presentation.
