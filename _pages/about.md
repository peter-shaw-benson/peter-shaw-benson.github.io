Hello! My name is Peter Benson, and I'm a fourth-year Computer Science and Music Technology major at Northeastern University.
I have worked at the Music Imaging and Neural Dynamics Laboratory (MIND Lab) with Dr. Psyche Loui since January 2023, and I am excited to continue my research career after I graduate in May 2024.

Before working at the MIND Lab, I had gathered research experience at the Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory working with Dr. Joel Graber.
My first co-op was in the public sector as a Data Analyst for the Procurement and Logistics department of the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority.

At the MIND Lab, I have applied these research skills to music – something I am deeply passionate about.
Here, I have led two projects relating low-level auditory features to phenomena such as music reward, experiences of groove, and perception of sound source.
I had the opportunity to present these findings at the 2023 Neuromusic Conference at McMaster University.
More information about these projects (and my other work) can be found in my [Portfolio](/portfolio).

Outside of the MIND Lab, I have been able to apply my music technology and software engineering skills to  other projects.
I am deeply passionate about audio engineering and the recording process, and I was able to pursue that passion to its limit with Green Line Records (GLR), a student-run record label.
As Head of Recording at GLR, I spread my knowledge and passion of audio engineering to new members, fostering the next generation of recording engineers.

During Summer 2023, I applied the same leadership skills to Develop For Good, a non-profit organization that provides other non-profits with volunteer software engineers and designers.
My team's project for the summer was to create a pipeline to predict fruit ripeness from climate data for the non-profit [Falling Fruit](https://fallingfruit.org).
Under my leadership, we adapted an existing algorithm for ripeness prediction to the data collected by Falling Fruit.

The [Portfolio](/portfolio) page contains work I have done in an official capacity – my work at the MIND Lab, Develop For Good, and Green Line Records.

In the [Personal Projects](/projects) page, you can find some of the work I have done in my free time.

Outside of school, some of my hobbies are rock climbing, hiking, playing bass, board games, and cooking.
