In 2023, I led a project performing a secondary analysis on a study previously conducted in the MIND Lab.
I analyzed the effect of individual musical reward sensitivity on experiences of groove and enjoyment of rhythmically complex stimuli.

I presented these findings at the 2023 Neuromusic Conference at McMaster University.
This project also resulted in a paper, which can be found at the bottom of this page.

*Abstract (as submitted to Neuromusic)*:

Groove, or the pleasurable urge to move to music, offers unique insight into the relationship between sensorimotor coupling with music and emotion. The predictive coding of music model suggests that groove is linked to predictions of music formed over time, with stimuli of moderate complexity rated as most pleasurable and most likely to engender movement. At the same time, individuals vary in the pleasure they derive from music listening:individuals with musical anhedonia report reduced pleasure during music listening. However, little is known about musical anhedonicsâ€™ subjective experience of groove.

Here, we explored the relationship between individual differences in music reward sensitivity and the pleasurable urge to move to music. A large online sample (n=287) listened to 15 drum-breaks selected to be either low, intermediate, or high on perceived complexity, and rated each on both how pleasurable and likely they were to move to them. Musical anhedonics (n=13) had significantly lower pleasure ratings, but not lower groove ratings, compared to controls (n=13) matched on music perception abilities and general anhedonia.

Across our entire sample, there was a significant positive relationship between music reward sensitivity and pleasure ratings that was strongest in response to highly complex stimuli, whereas move ratings were predicted by sensorimotor subscale even after controlling for all other subscales of musical reward. Results highlight the multidimensional nature of musical reward and suggest that pleasure and wanting to move are driven by separate but separable mechanisms that vary by stimulus complexity.
