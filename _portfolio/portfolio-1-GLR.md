During my Junior year, I was Head of Recording for a student-run record label. 
I revitalized the club after COVID, adding dozens of new members and training them to run their own projects. 
In addition, I collaborated with other departments (such as Artists & Repertoire) to decide on the club's signing strategy for discovering and recording new artists. 

The culmination of my time with Green Line was designing, creating a budget, and assembling a new recording studio, which was completed with $45K+ in funding during a planned renovation of the club's space. 
This new and improved space offers professional-level audio equipment while maintaining ease of use and accessibility for new members and musicians alike.
