In Spring 2024, I am working with Dr. Psyche Loui to relate low-level auditory features to imagined narratives during music listening.

Existing studies in narratives in music entail presenting a participant with an instrumental excerpt, then asking them to write down the story they imagined while listening to the excerpt.
Theses studies have shown that there is a considerable degree of consensus between participant-generated narratives.
Furthermore, attributes of these narratives are affected by individual personality traits (such as absorption in music and Big Five personality traits).

However, existing studies have not investigated the link between musical features of the excerpts and the imagined narratives.
In this project, I will be using Music Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing to investigate the emergence of consensus narratives during studies of imagined narratives.
