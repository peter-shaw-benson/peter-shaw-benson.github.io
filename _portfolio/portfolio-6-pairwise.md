For my New Interfaces in Musical Expression class (NIME) in Spring 2023, I sought to deepen my understanding of
groove by developing an expressive musical interface based on interpersonal synchrony.
The original idea was to find the "synchrony" of two people – how much they are moving in synch with each other.

In practice, this proved to be more difficult.
While measuring synchrony, I ran into the classic trade-off of high vs. low time resolution during data collection.
While high time resolution would be more accurate, it would also be very jittery and sensitive.
On the other hand, low time resolution would lag behind the performer.

The final project mapped the performer's gestures (specifically, the orientation of the device)
to musical features – in this case, I mapped the orientation to the cutoff of a low-pass filter.
I performed with this device at the end of the class to Daft Punk's song "One More Time".
